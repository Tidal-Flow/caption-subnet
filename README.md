# Bittensor Captioning Subnet

This repository provides a template for setting up a Bittensor subnet that processes audio data to generate captions. The subnet consists of miners that transcribe audio segments and a validator that evaluates their performance based on transcription accuracy.

## Overview

This template demonstrates how to:

- Set up miners that utilize a speech-to-text (STT) engine to transcribe audio data into captions.
- Implement a validator that evaluates the accuracy of the captions generated by miners using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER).
- Manage communication between miners and the validator using custom protocols.

## Project Structure

```
bittensor_subnet/
├── miner.py          # Miner node script for audio transcription
├── validator.py      # Validator node script for scoring miners
└── protocol.py       # Custom protocol definition for audio data
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Bittensor SDK](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor)
- Required libraries for audio processing (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bittensor_subnet.git
cd bittensor_subnet
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure STT Model

Ensure that you have the STT model configured correctly in `miner.py` to process audio data.

### 4. Register Miners

Register your miners on the Bittensor network using the provided CLI tools.

## Running the Miner and Validator

### Running the Miner

In one terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python miner.py --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner_hotkey --subtensor.network finney
```

### Running the Validator

In another terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python validator.py --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey validator_hotkey --subtensor.network finney
```

---

## Monitoring and Logging

Both the miner and validator will output logs to the console and save logs to files in the specified logging directory.

---

## Customization

You can modify the protocol and scoring logic in `protocol.py` and `validator.py` to suit your specific needs.

---

## Notes and Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure robust security measures are in place for production environments.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to manage edge cases and exceptions gracefully.
